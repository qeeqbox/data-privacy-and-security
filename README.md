### Data Classification

Data classification defines and categorizes data according to its type, sensitivity, and value. It helps ensure data confidentiality/integrity and makes it easier to access (Organizations usually design their data classification models and categories)

* * *

### Data Type

#### Content-based

Classification based on reviewing each piece of data and looking for sensitive information

#### Context-based

Classification based on metadata and environmental information (Indirect indicators of sensitive information) like the application or the person that created the document

#### User-base

Classification based on a person's discretion and knowledge (User needs to know what's inside the document)
